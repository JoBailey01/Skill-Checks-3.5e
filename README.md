# Skill-Checks-3.5e-
Makes ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks for a group of characters in D&D 3.5e. Any d20-based roll can easily be added to the system.

MakeChecks.java is the front-end code for this project. By modifying its code, a DM/GM can easily add new player characters or types of checks to the programme.
Note that all additions of checks and characters, at present, require modifying the code in MakeChecks.java. Reading them from a file would make more sense, but I haven't gotten around to implementing that functionality.
